## General Information
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. Goal is to address and meet the following criteria:

- Follow accessibility standards to optimise site for seach engines
- Ensure all links are functioning correctly
- Increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties
- Organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- Including comments before each element or section of the page

## Technologies used
Will only be using the following technologies: 

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Appearance
The following screenshot resembles the functionality and output of our webpage: 

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-demo.png)


## Features

Added an additional focus and hover ruleset on the navigation list elements.

## Setup
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- An Internet browser

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. 


## Room for Improvement

This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. The webpage can be improved to make elements responsive so that the web application is optimized for any screen size.
